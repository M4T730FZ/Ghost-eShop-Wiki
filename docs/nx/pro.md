Dear Donator,

here i show you whats the possibilities to use our Pro Services.

**PART 1 (Tinfoil)**
- Please setup the following to use the Pro Shop on Switch with Tinfoil:

```
Protocol: "https"
Host: "shop.nlib.cc"
Path: "/""
Username: [Your Login] (Its your eMail Address Name, example Max@Mustermann.de, its just "Max" and if you have "_" in it, change it to ".")
Password: [Your Password] (Different to a Panel, you have to setup the Tinfoil Password through the Panel)
Title: "Ghost eShop PRO"
```

**PART 2 (Website)**
**Go to:** [Pro Panel](https://pro.nlib.cc)

**Enter the following username and password:**
**Username:** [Your Login] (Its your eMail Address Name, example Max@Mustermann.de, its just "Max" and if you have "**_**" in it, change it to "**.**")
**Password:** [Your Password, shown in Mail]

This is on a separate Server, so you'll experience less slowdown than on the Free Shop.
