# Pro Shop

---

Dear Donator,

here i show you whats the possibilities to use our Pro Services.

**PART 1 (Tinfoil)**
- Please setup the following to use the Pro Shop on Switch with Tinfoil:

**Protocol:** *https*
**Host:** *shop.nlib.cc*
**Path:** */*
**Username:** *[Your Login]* (Its your eMail Address Name, example Max@Mustermann.de, its just "Max" and if you have "**_**" in it, change it to "**.**")
**Password:** *[Your Password]* (Different to a Panel, you have to setup the Tinfoil Password through the Panel)
**Title:** *Ghost Pro eShop*

**PART 2 (Website)**
**Go to:** [https://pro.nlib.cc]

**Enter the following username and password:**
**Username:** [Your Login] (Its your eMail Address Name, example Max@Mustermann.de, its just "Max" and if you have "**_**" in it, change it to "**.**")
**Password:** [Your Password, shown in Mail]

This is on a separate Server, so you'll experience less slowdown than on the Free Shop.
