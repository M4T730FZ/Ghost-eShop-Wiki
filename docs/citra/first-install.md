#### 🏁 1- Prerequisite :
In order to install the Ghost eShop homebrew, you will need :

* A hacked console 🏴‍☠️. (See [here](https://3ds.hacks.guide/))
* A .cia file installer, such as [FBI](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI), or the [Homebrew Launcher (∩ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)⊃━☆ﾟ](https://github.com/fincs/new-hbmenu) in order to start a .3dsx.
* A SD💾 Card with at least 2Gb of free space (Because even if the homebrew is only a few MB, it would be silly not to have space and therefore not to be able to install a game)
* And finally, a bit of patience...

#### 2- Installation :

In order to use the Homebrew Ghost eShop, you will of course need either the ```.cia``` or the ```.3dsx```

**Let's start with the ```.cia``` :**
There are two solutions available to you :
* Either download [GhostEshop.cia](https://cdn.ghosteshop.com/Homebrew/GhostEshop.cia) from a PC💻 or a téléphone📱 (Better to do it on a Windows or Linux PC)

    * Then put ```GhostEshop.cia``` on your SD card in ```sdmc:/CIAs/GhostEshop.cia```
    * Then switch on your console with your SD Card inserted in the front of the console, containing ```GhostEshop.cia```
    * Then go into the FBI homebrew
    * And then: ```SD > CIAs > Go down to GhostEshop.cia > click on the button (A) > Install and delete CIA > click on the button (A)```
    * After waiting for the end of the installation, press **once** on the button **(A)**
    * Then press **two** times on the button **(B)**
    * Then **once** on the ```start``` button

* Or the second solution is much faster and can be done from téléphone📱

    * To do this, turn on your console
    * Go to the FBI Homebrew
    * Once in the homebrew, go to ```Remote Install > Scan QR Code```
    * Then you just have to scan the QR Code just below : 
    <img src="https://cdn.ghosteshop.com/Homebrew/GhostEshop%20%28.cia%29.png" alt="3DS CIA QRCODE" width="200" height="200" />
    
    * Then click **once** on the button **(A)**
    * Wait for the end of the installation...
    * Then click **once** on the button **(A)**
    * Then **two times** on the button **(B)**
    * Then **once** on the ```start``` button


**Then, if you don't want to install the ```.cia```, it is also possible to start the Homebrew GhosteShop from a ```.3dsx```, which will then run with the Homebrew Launcher (∩ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)⊃━☆ﾟ :**
* Well, to start, we will download ```GhostEshop.3dsx```, and place it through a computer *(Phone not recommended for this part)*
    * To start, you will download [GhostEshop.3dsx](https://cdn.ghosteshop.com/Homebrew/GhostEshop.3dsx), if needed here is the ```.smdh``` : [GhostEshop.smdh](https://cdn.ghosteshop.com/Homebrew/GhostEshop.smdh)
    * Once downloaded, place ```GhostEshop.3dsx``` in ```sdmc:/3ds/GhostEshop.3dsx```
    * That's it, all you have to do is turn on the Homebrew Launcher (∩ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)⊃━☆ﾟ, then start the Homebrew Ghost eShop

* But, there is also another solution to be able to download the ```.3dsx``` directly from the console.
    * To do this, turn on your console
    * Go to the FBI Homebrew
    * Then in ```Remote Install > Scan QR Code```
    * Then you just have to scan the QR Code just below :
    <img src="https://cdn.ghosteshop.com/Homebrew/GhostEshop%20%28.3dsx%29.png" alt="3DS 3DSX QRCODE" width="200" height="200" />

    * Then click on the **once** on the **(A)** button
    * Wait for the end of the download...
    * Then click **once** on the button **(A)**
    * Then **two times** on the button **(B)**
    * Then **once** on the ```start``` button
    * Then all you have to do is start the Homebrew Launcher (∩ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)⊃━☆ﾟ
    * Then run the Homebrew Ghost eShop
