    Once in the connection settings, select ``Change Settings``, then on the second page click on ``Proxy Settings``, select ``Yes`` to enable it, and then select ``Detailed Setup``.

Now that you have access to the Ghost eShop 3DS beta, you shouldn't have to worry about Nintendo wiping out all the great games on the console of our childhood.


Please note:
- The proxy is and will remain active for beta and development purposes only, and will subsequently be replaced by a full eShop patch.
- As this is currently only a beta, we'll give you all the support we can in the event of a problem, but we're not responsible for any damage your console may suffer as a result of improper handling.
