#### üèÅ 1- Prerequisites :
To install the beta version of Ghost eShop 3DS, you will need the following :

* A console modded with lumaüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è. (See [here](https://3ds.hacks.guide/))
* And finally, a little patience...

#### 2- Setting up access to BETA :

* **First step :**

    Place [this patch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InternalLoss/3DS-SSL-Patch/master/code.ips) in your 3DS (micro) SD card, so that the file looks like this: ``sd:/luma/sysmodules/0004013000002F02.ips``.

* **Second Step :**

    Once this has been done, put your (micro) SD card back into your console, then start your console by pressing the ``select`` button on your console to access the luma configuration menu.
* **Third step :**

    Once on the luma configuration menu, make sure you have selected as shown in the image and then press the ``start`` button to save the configuration and restart the console.

* **Fourth step :**

    Once the console is fully powered up, go to: ``Console settings > Internet settings > Connection settings``
* **Fifth step :**

    You then have two choices, either ``New connection`` if your console isn't already connected to the Internet, or click on your current connection (for me it's ``Connection 1``, for example).
* **Sixth step :**

    Once in your connection settings, click on ``Edit``, then on the second page click on ``Proxy server``, click on ``Yes`` and then on ``Advanced settings``.
    <div><img src="screen/11.png" height="300px"></div>
* **Seventh step :**

    Then configure the proxy as shown in the screenshot below:
    <div><img src="screen/12.png" height="500px"></div>
* **Step n¬∞8 :**

    Then click on ``OK`` in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, then on ``Save``, then test your connection. If all goes well, you'll see the screenshot below:
    <div><img src="screen/13.png" height="300px"></div>
* **Step n¬∞9 :**

    Then return to your console's home menu and, to avoid any bugs or errors, reboot your console.
* **Step n¬∞10 :**

    Once all this is done, you should be able to access the eShop
    <div><img src="screen/14.png" height="300px"></div>
* **Step n¬∞11 :**

    Once in the eShop, press ``Menu`` (top left of the lower console screen), then scroll down to ``Settings/Other``.
* **Step n¬∞12 :**

    Then scroll down to the ``History`` section and click on ``Activities on your account``, you'll normally get a fake error message displaying your 3DS Key, as shown on the screen.
    <div><img src="screen/15.png" height="300px"></div>
* **Step n¬∞13 :**

    With a PC access [this page](https://ghseshop.cc/signup), you should get the same page as on the screenshot just below:
    <div><img src="screen/16.png" height="300px"></div>
* **Step n¬∞14 :**

    You'll need to register by entering : A user name (Username), an email if possible valid in case of problem or account recovery request (**no account recovery can be done without a valid email**), your 3DS Key that you should see on your 3DS as said before, then a password (Tip: do not put passwords used other passwords, do not put for example the same password as your email address ...).
* **Step n¬∞15 :**

    Once you've done that, you can click on the ``SIGN UP`` button, then log in if you're not.
    You should see the screenshot below:
    <div><img src="screen/17.png" height="300px"></div>
* **Last Step :**

    Enjoy ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚Äã


Now that you have access to the Ghost eShop 3DS beta, you shouldn't have to worry about Nintendo wiping out all the great games on the console of our childhood.


Please note:
- The proxy is and will remain active for beta and development purposes only, and will subsequently be replaced by a full eShop patch.
- As this is currently only a beta, we'll give you all the support we can in the event of a problem, but we're not responsible for any damage your console may suffer as a result of improper handling.
