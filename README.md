**Why create Ghost eShop ?**

Ghost eShop was creating basic, just like temp, but seeing that this one interested quite a lot of people, I decided to continue it, to improve it, in order to arrive at what you can have today.
___
**What is the relationship between the Ghost eShop, Ghost eShop Team and Universal-Team, Universal-Updater ?**

Universal-Updater of Universal-Team, during these old versions supported simple JSON scripts, so Ghost eShop was only a simple script, then it evolved into ``. unistore``, so you can add the sprites.
And then, there was the creation of the fork of Universal-Updater, at the moment, Ghost eShop is still a fork, on which we add improvements, such as the size of the games in the description of them, the additionel contents, more translation...

In short, if you want more information about Universal-Updater, which I recall and **against ghost eShop** and thus against the original idea of Ghost eShop.
